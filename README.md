## Directions for Setting up Environment-

To install the source, pre-requisites include-

- Python 3.6 or above
- Dependencies from requirements.txt

First, clone this repository onto your system. Then, create a virtual environment (I'm using pyenv but you can use anything):

```
cd path/to/folder
pyenv virtualenv 3.6.0 myenv
pyenv activate myenv
```

Now, install the python dependencies from requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Build the database by making migrations:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Finally, to pre-populate the "Destinations" table, run the following management command-
```
python manage.py load_destinations
```

## Directions to execute-

Inside the main project directory (the directory with the 'manage.py' file), run the following command to start the server-
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Now open the link shown in the terminal in any browser of your choice.
